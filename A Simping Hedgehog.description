A lonely, cynical, heartbroken man embarks on a path of self destruction. His own life has taught him how romanticism ruins love, but still he develops romantic love for another woman. Right when things seem to go well, there's a supernatural twist to the tale. Will he win against his fate? Is there anything called fate? Ouroboros and hedgehog's dilemma form the basis of this story.

# Prologue

This is a different prison. No, I’m not telling you about
the prison in which I was lawfully locked up. You’ll surely
understand, if I elaborate.

# Chapter 1- Long Good Bye

“You see. It takes time, but it will take place. You’ll listen
my  name  that  shall  be  uttered  by  your  every  customer.
They’ll  even  ask  you  about  my  whereabouts  and  you’ll
have to take the duty of fixing appointments so that they
can meet me in person.”, I told Sharan.

“Hahaha, you tell me the same thing everytime before you
publish  your,  novel.  None  of  the  things  you  say  will
happen.  The  same  old  song  and  no  effect.  So,  are  you
going to publish your next or what? “, Sharan scoffed at
me.

“No, Sharan. I haven’t even started pre-writing work yet.
This novel may be my swan song.”

“Thank God, finally you are leaving your literary career
that is no good for you. Right from your debut, you did
not gain a single rupee from it. Forget about some gain,
you  ran  into  losses  from  writing.  Because  of  that
government teacher job you do, you are on safe side. If
you  had  chosen  writing  as  your only  career,  you would
have been doomed long ago.”


# “You  too.  Same  old  song.  I  hope  my  next  novel  will
relieve you from the duty of an arm-chair critic, my friend.
“

“Hmmm. Let’s see.”

“I  am  leaving  to  Yanam  tomorrow  for  my  pre-writing
work.”

“How long will you be gone?”

“As of now, let’s say, five years.”

“Five years? What about your job?”

“I shall be on leave.”

“Money for your living at Yanam?”


# “I have been saving a decent amount since 1981.”

“From last 4 years? So, you are planning something big. I
cannot assure you, still, that your hardwork will pay off.
Anyhow, I pray that God shall bless this man-child and
even his brain-child.”

“Thank you.”

“Don’t you think it is foolish to still cling on to something
that is financially draining and still doesn’t get you at least
one-tenth of what you invested. Thanks to Hussain, you
published your novels through his publishing company.
Did his company at least recover the cost for printing and
marketing.  What  happened  in  the  end?  You  gave  free
copies of your novel to libraries. Rich people don’t care
about your novels, middle class people don’t need your
novels.  Poor  can’t  read  your  novels,  not  because  they
can’t  afford,  but  because  most  of  them  are  illiterate,  I
don’t read them because I don’t like your novels. I told
you  about  the  instances  when  I  got  your  torn  pages of
your novels to use it to pack tiffin from my hotel. Yet,
you don’t change, you moron.”


# “Bring, two chapathi, fast. I need to meet Hussain. It is
already 8:00 P.M.”

“You don’t have any shame, you still seek fame.”

Sharan brought chapathi.

“ Hey!, today is the first time a new curry is added in hotel
menu. I made it myself. Recipe is mine. Taste it and give
the feedback.”, Sharan boasted of his culinary skills.

“ Curry is great, Sharan.”

“ Thank you. Really?, is it that good?”

“ Yeah, it is as great as my novels.”

“  You  never  change. You,  moron.  By  the  way,  there  is
something I am worried about.”


# “What, dear? What is it?”

“Have  you  noticed?  Your  facial  features  are  changing
lately.”

“Yes, I have. Also, my shoes no longer fit me. My feet
size has been increasing lately. “

“Hey!, isn’t it the ring your father made? That ring, you
put on the thread necklace around your neck.”

“Yes. Even my finger girth increased over the course of
time during recent years. Now, I can’t put the ring on my
finger anymore.”

“ I guess you need to consult a doctor.”

“  Yes.  Thank  you  for  the  concern.  But,  I  shall  consult
doctor after I finish my novel.”

“ God, put some sense into his brain!”


# “ Bye, Sharan.”

“ Take care, you, sick head.”

“ Hello, Hussain!”, I greeted him.

“ Hey, Sahith! How are you? Long time, no see. Hey, hey,
hey!  Wait.  Your  face.  What’s  wrong  with  it?  Your  lips
became  thick,  brow  bone  prominent  and  jaw  line,  so
thick.”

“ I don’t know.”

“ Take care, man.”

I told Hussain that I am going to Yanam on finishing pre-
writing work for my next.


# “ Sahith, can you elaborate the idea you have? Why are
you going to Yanam all the way, and that too, for 5 years?
Can’t  you  get  the  information  in  local  libraries,  as  you
always do?”

“ Hussain, I read a book called ‘Psychopathia sexualis’, by
Richard von Krafft- Ebing. It was on January 13th,1981. I
read it in British Library at road no. 36, Jubilee Hills. In
that book, a peculiar word is used. The word is ‘sadism’.
Tracing back to the origins of the word. The origins lie in
18th century France. There was a French aristocrat called
Marquis de Sade. The word ‘sadism’ is based on his name.
Sade  was  a  novelist.  His  books  were  banned  due  to
extremely graphic violence which is often combined with
wild  sexual  perversions  to  a  nauseating  extent.  Sade
to  be
angered  Napoleon.  Napoleon  called  Sade
‘seditious’.  I  desperately  wanted  to  know  what  made  a
person write with such a depraved mind. I want to know
about his personal life. Not much information is available.
No doubt, since we know that even his books are banned,
nobody  really  likes  to  reveal  much  about  his  history.  I
tried to find every detail available about his personal life.
Though very less is available, I was very much intrigued
by those details. When I was in desperate search for the
answers, I met Francois. Francois is a French surgeon. I
met him by chance, when he came to Hyderabad to visit


# Salar Jung museum. I spoke to him. He revealed that his
ancestor was closely associated with Sade, when Sade was
imprisoned at Bastille prison. He also has private copies
of Sade’s novels. They were collected by his ancestor after
he was released. Francois’ ancestor even wrote about his
experiences  with  Marquis  de  Sade  and  some  exclusive
details  about  Sade.  Francois  is  closely  associated  with
Yanam.  When  Yanam  was  a  French  colony,  Francois’
family  members  had  matrimonial  relationship  with
Telugu people of Yanam. Francois visits Yanam once in
a while. Francois told me that he will come back to Yanam
in 1985. He gave me his contact address in  Yanam. He
told me that he would bring Sade’s novels and journals
his  ancestor  wrote  about  Sade.  I  am  basing  my
protagonist’s  character  on  Sade.  I  want  to  write
something so profound and relatable. I am going to write
the novel in Telugu only. It deals in depth with various
aspects like freedom, imprisonment, revolution, murder,
mayhem, torture, and roots of crime.”

“ Sahith, it sounds quite interesting. But, isn’t it a novel
that is going to deal with dark and brutal aspects of human
nature? Will people read it? “


# “  Hussain,  you  are  correct.  I  do  not  want  to  sugarcoat
things. I want to present brutality as brutality.”

“ All the best! I shall be waiting for your return.”

“ Thank you, Hussain. I am ever grateful to you. At the
time  when  no  publisher  accepted  my  work,  you  came
forward. When every publisher deemed my work to be a
risky endeavour which just leaves them with losses, you
helped me out. You are a true admirer of literature. You
liked my works and published them, even though they left
you with losses. I am sure that my next novel is going to
be my Magnum Opus. Please, do this last favour. I want
it to be published on a large scale.”

“  There  are  novels  which  give  profits  by  pleasing  the
masses.  Then,  there  are  novels  which  do  not  please
everyone,  which  do  not  give  profits,  but  they  hit  some
people hard. Those people resonate  with the themes  in
these novels. Their lives are impacted in a good way, by
these novels. You are one of those few authors that can
do this. Your novels are way ahead of time. They are slow
burn. They take their own sweet time to build a setting
which  leads  to  an  impactful  conclusion.  People  need


# constant  rush  of  adrenaline.  Your  novels  can’t  do  that.
But, if read with patience, they can be very satisfying.”

“  Thank  you,  Hussain.  You  are  the  only  one  who
understood my works so well. Good bye, Hussain. Take
care.”


# Chapter 2 – Yanam
Yanam is a very beautiful place. The greenery here gives
me very positive feeling. The people, here, are very kind
and  helpful.  I  met  Francois  and  greeted  him.  I  tried  to
remind him about me.

“ Hey! Mr. Sahith, I remember you now. What’s wrong
with you face?”

“ I don’t know, sir.”

Francois asked me a few questions about my health. He
gave me a checklist and asked me to tick the check boxes
based  on  the  questions.  They  are  related  to  my  health.
After  I  submitted  it  to  Francois,  he  examined  it
thoroughly. He performed tests on me. He revealed that
I  have  acromegaly.  He  explained  me  the  condition.  He
told me that it is caused due to benign pituitary tumour
which  is  responsible  for  excessive  secretion  of  growth
hormone.

“  See,  Mr.  Sahith.  You  must  definitely  undergo  surgery
and get rid of the tumor. Otherwise, there will be more


# complications for you. Obstruction of upper airway due
to  enlargement  of  tongue  and  thickening  of  laryngeal
cartilages, that may cause sleep apnea, which may lead to
death.  Acromegaly,  further  causes  heart  problems,  and
diabetes. If left untreated, it will lead to vision problems
due  to  compression  of  optic  chiasma.  You  can  never
finish your novel.”

“ Sir, please help me. I must finish that novel, sir. “

“ There is no  other  way, other  than the surgery. It will
cost ₹1,00,000.”

“ Sir, all the money I have been saving from the time I
joined as an English teacher at government school, is now
₹1,50,000. I do not own any property. You are saying that
it would require 2/3rd of what I saved, can’t I get any less
affordable treatment, sir? I have to stay in Yanam for at
least 5 years. I need money to stay here. It will at least cost
₹50,000 for five years. I need to save more money as a
buffer.  That  money  will  help  me  publish  my  novel  if  I
have to face the worst case scenario after five years.”


# “ There is no other way to skip the treatment, except, if
you wish to die. But, there is a way to save that ₹50,000.
You  can  stay  at  my  residence  and  eat  the  food  we  eat,
these five years.”

“  Thank  you  so  much,  Dr.Francois.  Thank  you  sir,  for
your benevolence. I shall definitely repay for this, sir.”

The surgery was successful. I stayed with Dr.Francois. He
gave  me  all  those  manuscripts  and  Sade’s  novels.  Dr.
Francois opened a surgical care clinic in Yanam. I was the
first one to be operated there. He stayed there for those
five years and guided his protégé, Praveena, his brother’s
daughter.  His  brother  married  a  Yanam  woman,  and
settled there. So, Dr.Francois would visit Yanam often.
Dr. Francois left the hospital to Praveena, and went back
to France. Those 5 years are the best part of my life.

I prepared a notes analysing Sade’s novels, also on Sade’s
notorious life, and tallied the information from Francois’
ancestor’s  journals.  Dr.Francois  gave  a  copy  of  Sade’s
novel, “120 days of Sodom” to Praveena. She fainted after
reading half of the novel. She cursed us for making her
read it, and called Sade, a monster. On the other hand,
Dr. Francois had let me know that Sade was praised by a
French  feminist  activist  and  existentialist  philosopher,


# Simone  de  Beauvoir. I  was  so  shocked and  intrigued.  I
went on to know more about Sade. But, little is known
about Sade’s early years that explains his later fascinations
with sex and torture. Some of the Sade’s quotations were
very  profound.  I  used  to  sit  on  the  banks  of  Godavari
river, and speculate about Sade’s childhood. This formed
the  entire  psyche  of  my  protagonist.  Throughout  the
history, Sade was portrayed as a monster. But, the more I
find  out  about  him,  a  more  human  portrait  of  that
monster  is  formed,  just  like  my  protagonist.  Or  my
protagonist is like him. Their both personalities merged
so well that we either cannot say my protagonist is based
on him or they both are exactly same people who lived in
different eras, one really lived, and the other lived in my
imagination. I used to ponder a lot, day dream a lot about
my story, plot, themes and characters, just by sitting on
banks  of  Godavari  river.  It  was  so  soothing.  I  finally
finished the manuscript of my novel on September 15th,
1990.  Final  draft  was  3000  pages  long.  I  gave  the
manuscript to Dr.Francois. He took help of Dr.Praveena
to understand it. Thankfully, Praveena did not faint this
time.  Moreover,  she  liked  the  novel  very  much.  Dr.
Francois  liked  it,  as  well.  He  asked  me  whether  I  was
trying to portray a devil as an angel.

I replied, “ For me, it is not a question of redemption –
making devil into an angel. Surely, my protagonist was a
mix  of  both,  just  like  Sade.  In  fact,  like  every  human.


# Every human is a mix of both evil and good- will. But,
they hide the evil under the shrouds, repress it to make it
express  itself,  in  the  most  horrifying  ways,  one  can
imagine.  But,  Sade  and  my  protagonist  projected
themselves as evil, shamelessly and courageously.”

I am leaving Yanam. I never felt so attached to a place. It
was the feeling I felt 21 years ago, when I was 12 years
old. Finishing this novel felt like a therapy, somehow. It
was  like  treating  my  broken  12  year-old  self.  Probably,
because of the themes I discussed in this novel.

I took the manuscript, and visited Rajarajeshwara temple
and  Venkanna  Babu  temple  near  Yanam.  I  took  the
manuscript  to  Yanam  mosque  and  Catholic  Church  at
Yanam. I am grateful to God, that I am still alive, now,
breathing  right  at  this  moment.  I  am  grateful  to  Dr.
Francois, and all the other people who helped me to pull
through during tough times.

Yanam is so beautiful, that I wanted to stay there after my
retirement.


# Chapter 3 - Please, publish.

I went back to my home. Sharan is the house owner since
his father’s death. Sharan is actually 5 years elder than me.

“ During your entire stay, at Yanam, you called me only
twice.  One  time  before  you  were  operated,  and  other,
after  surgery.  Were  you  so  busy,  all  the  other  time?”,
Sharan asked me.

“ My health is the only thing you concern about me. All
the  other  days,  I  was  busy  with  creation.  My  creations
mean nothing to you, so I did not call you.”, I replied.

“ Hmmm. True. What do you eat for supper, now?”

“ Get me 2 chapathi, with the special curry you make.”

“ It’s good that you still remember.”


# “  How  can  I  forget  something  that  is  as  great  as  my
novels? “

“ The same overconfidence and superiority complex.”

The next day, I met Hussain. Hussain’s financial position
was so bad, then. His publishing company ran into losses.

“ Sahith, I’m sorry. I’m in no position to help you. A lot
of things happened in these 5 years. Please contact some
other  publisher.  I’m  sorry  for  not  keeping  up  my
promise.”

“ Hussain, please do not be sorry. If there is any way, I
can help you, I shall do it.”

“ I’m in need of some money.”

“ Please let me know, Hussain. If I can arrange, I shall do
it for you.”


# “ ₹30,000”

I gave ₹ 30,000 to Hussain, from my savings. I rejoined
as  a  government  teacher.  I  was  assigned  to  a  different
school,  after  5  year  long  leave.  It  is  far  away  from  my
residence. I had to shift to another house, close to the new
school. I could meet Sharan, just once in a week.

I contacted every other publisher with my work.

“ Your novel is long and boring.”, first publisher said.

“ It’s too dark and violent.”, said the other.

“ It’s anti social.” , said some other publisher.

“ I want to suggest a few changes to your novel. If you
consider the changes, I shall publish this for you.”, said
the last publisher.


# I asked him for his suggestions.

“  Your  novel  starts  with  depiction  of  a  sexual  act,
followed  by  a  brutal  murder.  There  are  no  sexual  acts,
later in this novel. There is only gore. Since you already
contaminated your novel with depiction of such an act,
why don’t you cut down, the gory and violent episodes,
remove those philosophical monologues, cut the number
characters to half, and sexualize your work more? Then
your  work  can  be  published  as  an  erotic  thriller.  It  can
please a lot of readers. There is a separate fan base to that.
Most importantly, your protagonist is a psychopath. He is
flawed.  People  can’t  root  for  the  characters  with  flaws.
Their  conscience  won't  accept  that.  You  wrote  a  cop
character in the novel. Make, him, as the protagonist of
your story. Don’t forget to add a female character, who is
the cop’s love interest. Narrate the story only from cop’s
point of view, not from that sick psychopath’s point of
view.  I  guarantee  you,  that  your  novel  will  become  an
instant bestseller. What do you say?”

“ Sorry, sir. You did not get the whole point of my novel.
Please, publish it as it is, sir.”


# “ Hey, author! I understood the point of your novel. But,
90% of the readers don’t like that stuff. According to me,
any  form  of  fiction  is  only  meant  for  entertaining  the
consumers.  You  give  your  consumers,  a  constant
adrenaline rush, or a dopamine feast, in exchange for what
they pay. You have to make changes to please the people,
only then, I can publish. This is business.”

“ Thank you, sir. I understand what you say. But, I don’t
agree with what you say. What you believe in, is a myth,
sir.”

For  me,  fiction  is  not  just  entertainment.  It  is  beyond
entertainment. That doesn’t mean that fiction should give
a message to the readers. Rather, it has a power to make
people think, reflect and introspect. I think, art, writing,
movies and any other form of fiction is very important.
They  can  actually  represent  what  you  went  through  in
your  own  life,  in  an  impactful  way,  through  characters,
and then you can see how the characters react and deal
with it. May be you can relate to it, in some way. Even if
it  has  not  happened  to  you.  Watching  it  or  seeing  it
happen to another character, and seeing what their lives
are like, when they’re going through that, may give you a
little bit  more  empathy.  The  art,  sometimes,  is  there  to


# make you incredibly uncomfortable. Sometimes, we, the
authors,  can  deal  with  seriously  awkward  stuff,  in  a
humorous way. It becomes dark humour. But, I chose not
to deal my 5th novel, ‘Sadist’, in a humorous way. It is dark,
and I wanted it to be, as dark as, it needs to be. Some of
the themes, I discussed in ‘Sadist’, resonate with my own
life,  but  in  a  very  exaggerated  way.  But,  it  still  bears
allegories to our real world, and real lives.

Five  years  had  passed,  by  then.  It  was  1995.  My  novel
remained,  unpublished.  This  is  certainly  not  my  lowest
point. Yet, I feel depressed.


# Chapter 4 - My family

My father was a blacksmith. He used to make all kinds of
iron related tools. He made an iron ring for me. It was a
gift for my 11th birthday. The ring was made in such a way
that, it would fit on my finger, even when I grew older.
But,  it  no  longer  fits  on  my  finger,  due  to  acromegaly.
Further  increase  in  growth  was  stopped,  thanks  to
surgery. But, already grown parts did not restore to their
original size. The changes in facial features made me look
like a monster.

I was a very social person until my 12th birthday. My father
was convicted for murder, on my 12th birthday. My father
confessed to his crime. Court ordered for penalty to be
paid. We sold our house for that purpose. My father was,
later,  sentenced  to  death.  From  the  time  of  his  arrest,
everyone in the town and school, started treating us in a
different  manner.  I  was  branded  as  ‘son  of  a  criminal’.
The  stares  of  people  at  me,  and  my  mother  gave  me
creeps. We could not escape the stigma and the bias.

“  The  victim  was  killed  in  a  murderous  rage.”,  police
stated.  Killing  a  person  is  not  at  all  justifiable.  But,  my
father was my father, before he turned into a murderer.

# As  his  son,  I  still  love  him,  as  my  father.  No  one  is
concerned  about  why  my  father  killed  that  person.  My
father’s last words before he was hung to death. His last
wish was to speak to me and my mother.

“My dear son, a customer approached me on that day. He
was very short tempered. We had an argument. I lost my
cool when he called me, ‘son of a bitch’, and badmouthed
my deceased mother.

I stabbed him to death with the knife I made. I told police
the  same  thing.  People  believe  nothing,  without  any
proof.  I  have  no  proof.  What  happened  between  two
people
in  absence  of  others,  always  has  multiple
interpretations, the side of story narrated by one person,
the side of story narrated by another person involved, and
the truth. Scolding someone is not an offence. But, killing
is. I made a grave sin in a murderous rage. I was easily
offended by that person. People try to offend you in every
way possible, but, don’t be offended. Whatever I told you
about why I killed him, don’t tell anyone about that. You
will be treated as fool. The person I killed, was a doctor.
He was a person, highly esteemed in the society. No one
believes  that  someone  like  him  uttered  such  terrible
words.  It  was  a  completely  contrasting  behaviour  from
the  way  he  behaves  in  front  of  others.  He  might  have
been  so  frustrated  that  day.  Other  than  that,  he  was  a


# good man. I couldn't control  my rage. I killed him.  He
had a family, too. Now, I have nothing left, but, guilt. Stay
strong, my son. Now, because I am a criminal, people will
try to hurt you, offend you easily. It would be very easy
for them. Take good care of your mother, when you grow
big. Good bye, my son.”

Those were the last words of my father. They are hitting
me  harder,  now,  while  I  am  sitting  in  this  prison,  and
thinking of what I had done.

When I was 14, we left our town. We came to Hyderabad.
I gradually turned into an asocial person, during those two
years. In  Hyderabad, we  were given  shelter by Sharan’s
father. When they asked my mother about my father, my
mother explained them about our situation. They never
judged us. They never treated me like I am the son of a
criminal. A new place, a new school, new classmates and
new family. Sharan, too, lost his mother when he was 12
years old. His father never remarried. Sharan became my
best friend. I started to socialize. But my new social life
did not last long. My mother used to work as a maid, at a
landlord’s  house.  His  name  was  Thrigun.  He  asked  my
mother to have sex with him, in exchange for money. My
mother  gently  refused.  He  forced  himself  on  to  my


# mother. My mother stuck a knife in his eyeball, and quit
the job. Thrigun, that one-eyed monster, sent people to
our  residence.  Those  people  told  our  neighbourhood
about my father’s crime. They even came to school, and
told  everyone  about  my  father’s  crime.  This  greatly
damaged my social life. The stares and glares troubled me
more, during that time. The only wise thing, Thrigun did,
was  not  filing  an  assault  case  on  my  mother.  It  would
reveal his true nature to the society. I felt like, at least my
mother  was  with  me,  and  not  in  jail.  They  would  have
branded me with something like, ‘son of criminals. A few
months later, that year, on a bright sunny day ( I didn’t
want  to  remember  the  date.),  I  lost  my  mother  to  an
illness,  which  she  never  told anyone  about.  My  mother
deliberately,  did  not  get  the  treatment.  We  don’t  know
why.


# Chapter 5 - The critic
I started saving some money, again. In those five years, I
saved  some  decent  amount,  so  that  I  can  get  my  book
published,  using  Hussain’s  company  staff.  By  God’s
grace, Hussain told me that he recovered from losses, and
can spare some money. His help is much needed now. We
used the money we have, and printed a limited edition of
my  novel.  I  requested  Hussain  to  print  photos  of  my
parents on the backside of the cover page. Since the novel
is  long,  we  could  not  print  much.  A  total  of  89  copies
were made. We started to market our work. We gave free
copies  to  five  people,  initially.  We  got  mixed  reviews.
Media  did  not  come  forward  to  promote  it.  It  was
probably due to the contents of the novel.

There  was  a  social  activist  and  literary  critic,  named
Bhushan.  He  has  a  great  reputation  among  society.  He
can easily get the appointment of local MLAs, so that he
can tell them about the problems of the masses.

Hussain, finally, got a chance to meet him. He requested
Bhushan to read my novel, and give a critique of the novel
to  either  newspapers  or  news  channels.  He  assured
Hussain,  that  he  would  read  the  novel.  He  asked  for  a
copy of our novel, the next day.


# We went to his house, the next day. Thrigun was there! I
told Hussain, not to give the copy to Bhushan, then. We
withdrew from giving the copy to Bhushan, that day.

I  did  not  understand  why  Thrigun  was  there.  I  asked
Hussain to find out the relationship between Thrigun and
Bhushan.

Thrigun was Bhushan’s father-in- law.

But  I  couldn’t  judge  the  character  of Bhushan.  If  I did
that,  there  won’t  be  any  difference  between  those  who
branded me as ‘son of criminal’, and me.


# Chapter 6 - The criticism

Bhushan had an office of staff, who work collectively to
in  famous  magazines  and
publish  book  reviews
newspapers.  Every  review  is  evaluated  by  Bhushan,
before sent to magazines. One of the staff members, was
among the people who received free copy of my novel.
Apparently,  he  wrote  a  review.  He  contacted  me  and
congratulated me. He told me that he liked my novel very
much.  I  felt  so  happy.  It  was  coming  from  Bhushan’s
office. But, the review had not been sent to any magazine.
He told me that Bhushan sir wanted to read your work,
and then write his review separately, and then, send it to
the magazine.

It  was  2  days  later,  I  think.  Yeah,  it  was  2  days  later.
Hussain  called  me  and  asked  me  to  his  office,  since  I
didn’t have television at my home.

Bhushan was ranting on a TV channel about my novel. It
went on like this….

“Today, I am going to review a novel called, ‘Sadist’. It
was  written  by  Sahith.  The  not-so-popular  author  who


# had already written 4 books, previously. This word, sadist,
is relatively new. I studied its origins, so you don’t have
to. Let’s simply know it’s meaning. A sadist is someone
who feels pleased, when he inflicts pain on others. Okay,
that is the context you need to know, before you listen to
the actual review. Fine. Let’s start…”, Bhushan drank a
glass of water, after he said this. Bhushan continued with
his review….

“What does this foolish author think of himself. If people
of this civilized society read this book, they go mad and
turn  into  monsters,  there  by  causing  an  entire  chaos  in
this orderly society. This piece of fiction is the worst of
it’s kind. This is a horrifying book. It is anti-social in every
possible way. This author is an absolute psychopath. He
is a jerk. He is a freak. He is mentally ill. People like him
should be locked up in asylum or should be thrown in jail
for  writing  offensive  content  like  this.  We  dug  into  his
personal life to know what made him think and write in
such a deranged way. We have known horrifying secrets
about  his  personal  life.  His  father  was  a  murderer,who
was hung to death. Look at these police records about his
father. His father murdered a doctor. A doctor who gave
improved quality of lives to many. Now, we need to speak
something  about  his  mother.  His  mother  died  of  a
disease.  Remember  this  detail.  No  one  knew  how  she
died. But, we found out. His mother and the author used
to live at a hotel owner’s house. The hotel owner died a


# month after the death of author’s mother. The symptoms
suffered  by  hotel  owner  and  the  author’s  mother  were
same. The symptoms were similar to Gonorrhoea. There
were several rumours that both of them had that kind of
relationship. The hotel owner was single, after the death
of his wife. Sahith’s mother was also single. So, they might
have  started  that  sort  of  relationship,  to  cope  up  with
loneliness.  There  is  no  chance  that  Gonorrhoea  spread
from  hotel  owner  to  Sahith’s  mother.  There  are  two
reasons to solidify this assumption. If the hotel owner was
infected first, he would have died earlier due to excessive
spread  of  infection  within  his  body.  That  hotel  owner
never went to any brothel. Author’s mother used to work
as a maid at several houses. She might have maintained
multiple  sexual  relations  for  money.  There  might  be  a
high  probability  that  she  contracted  Gonorrhoea  first.
What a woman, she is!

We  found  out  that,  this  author  never  spoke  to  anyone
during his school years. He had difficulties in socializing
with  others.  His  family  background,  his  social  life,  his
personality, all these things give us a clear cut picture of
his fractured mental health. He is a sick man. If anyone
reads  this  novel,  they’ll  surely  become  murderers  and
psychopaths. Please, do  not support these  kind  of mad
people. I have seen the author’s face, so you don’t have
to. He is like a monster. He is a scarecrow who can even
scare  humans.  No  wonder  why  he  is  unmarried.  What


# kind of girl comes forward to marry a monster like him.
Moreover, this novel contains a few anti-Hindu aspects.
The  protagonist  is  a  Hindu.  He  is  portrayed  as  a
psychopath.  He  never  stood  by  basic  principles  of
Hinduism. Why should a Hindu be villain in this novel? I
shall tell you why. This book is refused to be published by
every  publisher,  except  his  muslim  friend,  Hussain.  To
publish this novel, he had to please the publisher, that is,
Hussain.  So,  the  novel  had  these  anti-Hindu  aspects.  I
strongly  believe that this author is an  atheist. He  might
have  never  gone  to  a  temple.  Worst  part,  of  all,  is  the
novel is written vividly in Telugu. It is the local language,
which everyone knows. So, many people can easily read
this shit. This shit encourages people to commit crimes.
What does he think of himself? if you have freedom of
expression, will you freely use it to this damaging extent.
You should at least have shame. The horrible thing is, the
first page of the novel contains depiction of fellatio. The
next  chapter  of  the  novel  has  gruesome  violence.  The
female character introduced in first chapter is an infidel.
Out  of  3000  pages,  1000  pages  is  depiction  of  graphic
violence. The author Is a pseudo-intellectual. He tries to
show off, that he has knowledge. The author is a joke that
no one laughed at, and because of that, he began taking
himself so seriously. I can’t say anything more than this. I
wrote  a  letter  to  government,  requesting  it  to  ban  this
novel and cease any further publication of this novel.”


# Sharan met me.

“That  fucker,  how  dare  he  bring  you  and  Hussain  into
this? Sharan, do you believe in what he told people about
my mother?”

“Hey, Sahith! Shut your mouth, now. I trust my father,
and  your  mother.  That  bastard  made  up  all  this  shit  to
break you down. We know the egoistic bitch behind this,
that  Thrigun,  his  pride  was  hurt  by  your  mother.  He
doesn’t have any proof to backup that shit he blabbered
about your mother.”

“Neither we have any proof, to prove their assumption
wrong.”, I said.

Sharan cried. He hugged me, and consoled me.

I went to Bhushan’s house. I was pushed out, by security
guard.


# My  book  was  banned.  Further  publishing  is  ceased.  I
faced  troubles  at  my  workplace.  The  same  way  I  was
treated, when others knew I was a son of criminal. In fact,
worse  than the  treatment  I got when I was a child. My
colleagues ,students and their parents, and their glares. I
resigned  my  job.  My  students  stopped  respecting  me.
They stopped listening to my classes. When I questioned
them for interrupting my classes, they told me that they
didn’t want to listen to an immoral person like me.

The  beginning  of  my  novel  was  deliberately  written  in
such a way. It is a warning sign to the reader. If the reader
could bear it, the reader could read the entire novel. My
novel  is  not something  that should  be  read  if someone
recommends  it.  The  reader  herself/himself  should  get
into  the  novel.  Yes,  my  novel  is  brutal.  Yes,  my
protagonist is evil. But he is not eviller than Bhushan and
Thrigun.  Instead  of  simply  telling  people,  that  my
protagonist is a sadist, I showed them how sadistic he is.
Getting  something  told  vs  getting  something  shown
triggers  a  different  emotion  and  reaction.  Yes,  there  is
graphic violence in my novel. But there is also something
beyond  the  violence.  Remaining  2000  pages  shows  the
redemption of my protagonist. I never glorified violence.
I  never  justified  murder  in  my  novel.  Even  though  the
protagonist is redeemed, he dies at the end of the novel,


# as  a  price  he  pays  for  his  sins.  I  wrote  some  of  the
strongest female characters in my novel. He only spoke
of  the  woman  involved  in  infidelity.  He  spoke  nothing
about all these. Not even a single thing.


# Chapter 7 - Punishment or crime?

I  came  to  know  everything  about  what  happened.
Thrigun saw the photo of my mother on the backside of
cover page of my novel. He couldn’t forget his missing
eyeball and the rage he got while thinking of how he lost
it. He told his son-in-law to destroy me in every possible
way. They won. I had lost everything in my life, except
my life. But I was dead inside.

For a month, I was lying low, collecting every detail about
Bhushan. Observing his daily routine, and every minute
detail about him.

It was that night, I struck him when he least expected me.

That night, Bhushan’s wife visited Thrigun’s home along
with her son. Bhushan was alone at his home. There was
only one security guard in front of his house, as usual. It
was 11:00 P.M.

My father’s iron tools are the only properties I inherited
from my father. I took my father’s trunk box out. It has


# knives,  crow  bars  and  other  tools.  All  of  them  were
rusted,  including  the  trunk  box.  I  was  sharpening  the
knives from past one month. I went to Sharan’s house. I
asked him to prepare 2 chapathi with the special curry and
packed the chapathi and curry in a box.

I reached Bhushan’s house by an auto.

I made sure the auto left. I tucked the knife in waist band
of my trousers. Carrying the trunk box in my right hand,
I greeted the guard, threw the trunk box on him. I stuffed
my handkerchief into his mouth, disabling him to alert the
neighbourhood  by  shouting.  I  took  the  knife  out,  and
performed  hamstringing  to  both  his  legs.  I  grabbed  his
phone from his pocket, preventing him from calling the
police.  I  dragged  him  to  the  main  door.  The  door  was
locked from the outside.

“ Hey! Why is the door locked from outside? I know that
fucker  is  inside.  Isn’t  he?”,  I  asked  the  guard,  with  my
knife on his neck, and slightly pulled the handkerchief out
of his mouth.


# “Yes, he is. He is with the housemaid. He told me to lock
the door from outside, and not to allow anyone to avoid
any sort of disturbance.”

I stuffed back the handkerchief in his mouth.

“Wow! Give me the keys then.”

I opened the door, and pushed the guard into the house.
I  locked  the  door  from  inside.I  went  straight  into
Bhushan’s  bedroom  upstairs.  I  had  found  out  his
bedroom when I heard moans as I was climbing the stairs.
I cracked the door open, with a crowbar.

He  was  shocked.  He  yelled  at  me  like  a  mad  dog.  He
shouted to call the guard.

I ran towards Bhushan, jumped on the bed and cut both
his  Achilles’  tendons  with  the  knife.  Bhushan  was
groaning  in  pain  and  despair.  Maid  was  crying  and
shouting.

I took Bhushan’s cell phone and broke it to pieces with
the help of crowbar.

“Thank you Bhushan, for being naked. I don’t understand
the housemaid fetishes you and your father-in-law have. I
absolutely  hate  hypocrites  like  you,  and  your  father-in-
law. Mrs. Maid, please put on your clothes and follow me.
You can fuck him later, if he is alive.”


# I locked the maid in the next room, gave her a glass of
water. I told her not make any noise. If she violated this
rule, I warned her that I would kill her.

I  took  Bhushan’s  shirt  from  his  wardrobe,  and  went
downstairs. I tied it to guard to prevent bleeding from his
cuts.  I  gave  a  glass  of  water  to  guard.  I  removed  my
handkerchief  from  his  mouth,  it  shouldn’t  trouble  him
anymore.

I  went  back  to  Bhushan,  to  complete  the  unfinished
business with him.

I tied Bhushan to the bed. I set him in lithotomy position.
I pulled out the pinch point crowbar from the the trunk
box. I took out chapathi I brought from Sharan. I stuffed
curry in it, and prepared rolls. I put one roll in Bhushan’s
mouth.

“Mr. Guard, are you hungry?”, I shouted.

“Yes, sir.”, the guard shouted.


# I  inserted  the  pinch  point  crowbar  into  Bhushan’s  anal
orifice, and pushed it inside, a bit. He opened mouth, to
groan in pain, and chapati roll slid a bit into his pharynx,
and gag reflex occurred. Masala in the curry agitated the
cough. I learnt a decent amount of anatomy, when I had
stayed with Dr. Francois.

“Are  there  any  fruits  in  your  refrigerator,  Bhushan?”,  I
was asking him while I took the roll out of his mouth.

He  nodded  his  head  to  confirm  that  fruits  were  in
refrigerator. He was gasping.

I pushed the crowbar a little bit inward, and gave fruits to
both the maid and the guard.

I  churned  the  interior  of  his  abdomen,  for  a  while,  by
rotating the crowbar around its long axis, clockwise and
anti-  clockwise.  He  was  crying  in  pain.  I  withdrew  the
pinch point crowbar from his alimentary canal.


# He was groaning louder. It must had been so painful. He
was reminding me that he had a son, and a loving family.
He  told  me  that  his  son  would  lose  his  father.  He  was
begging for his life. Speaking out, would have never been
so painful and nearly impossible to him.

No, I was not showing any sympathy or empathy for him.

I took out another crowbar. The crowbar with hook end.
I inserted it through his torn anal orifice. I pushed it all
the way inside, and pulled it back, eviscerating his viscera.
His abdominal visceral organs came out. It was a radical
disembowelment. He would stay alive for, at least, 5 more
minutes,  probably.  He  was  profusely  bleeding.  I  asked
him whether he had any video camera. He lifted his hand
and  pointed  his  index  finger  towards  the  cupboard.  I
focused  it  only  on  his  face.  He  said  that  he  was  wrong
about my mother, and Sharan’s father. It was recorded.

I  stuffed  last  roll  of  chapathi  in  his  mouth,  so  that  his
groaning sounds are muffled, and he could hear what I
tell him.


# “You  told  people  that  I  am  an  atheist.  No.  I  actually
believe in God. You told people that I might have never
gone to temple. I placed written manuscript of my novel
in a temple, a mosque and a church. Do you know that?
You don’t even need the truth. Why do you bring religion
aspect? Why create hatred between communities just to
destroy  one  person?  Why  did  you  trouble  Sharan  by
linking his dead father to my dead mother? You wanted
to shame the dead, to trouble the living. Whom would the
masses believe? Someone who is clean or someone with
a  tag  called  ‘son  of  criminal’?  Since  they  believe  you
blindly, you have to at least speak out the truth. When I
was in 7th standard, one of my classmates lost his watch.
The  boy  who  stole  his  watch,  put  it  in  my  bag  and
scapegoated  me.  He  convinced  others  that  I  am
responsible  for  it.  He  told  them  that  I  am  son  of  a
criminal,  so  I  am  capable  of  committing  crime.  People
stopped believing what I say. Forget about their belief in
me,  people  stopped  taking  me  seriously.  So,  I  began
telling them fictitious stories. You didn’t even let me do
that peacefully. You wanted to make me dumb. Finally, I
want to make one thing clear to you. I wrote the novel,
about a sick mind, not with a sick mind.”

He was dead.


# There  was  a big mirror hung in the room in  which  the
maid  was  locked.  I  told  her  to  leave  the  place.  When  I
looked  into  the  mirror,  I  saw  a  monster.  I  was  the
monster. Looking into the eyes of that monster ,was like
looking into an endless abyss.

I  called  the  police  using  guard’s  phone  and  waited  for
their arrival to arrest me.

I  confessed  to  everything.  I  gave  them  the  video  I
recorded.  I  became  a  famous  person  overnight.  I  was
given  lifetime  imprisonment.  I  had  not  understood
whether I punished him for his misdeed or committed a
crime by killing a person. What could be the situation of
Bhushan’s  son.  He  had  to  go  through  what  I  went
through as a child. I could never forgive myself for that. I
incapacitated  Bhushan’s
performing
hamstringing.  He  may  never  walk  properly,  again.  It
would  make  him  crippled  and  unemployed.  I  couldn’t
forgive myself for that.

What are your views on my deed? Is it a punishment or
crime?


# Epilogue - Aftermath of murder

Bhushan’s  family  is  shattered  when  ugly  truths  about
Bhushan and Thrigun came into light.

Many psychiatrists and psychologists showed interest in
my  case.  They  bought  the  copies  of  my  book  from
Hussain.  They  used  it  for  the  study  purpose.  They
consulted  me  personally  by  visiting  my  prison.  They
praised me for my work. They told me that my work was
an  extensive  psychological  study.  They  told  me  that  an
absolutely remorseless psychopath was transformed into
a  highly  empathetic being,  and  repented  for  his  crimes,
after reading my novel. They told me that my novel was
not  very  violent,  then  most  of  the  Hollywood  slasher
movies.  One  of  the  psychiatrist  told  me,  “If  the  crows
aren’t  scared  of  scarecrow,  and
look  beyond  the
appearance,  they  can  actually  enjoy  the  fruits  of  crop
field.” These intellectuals greatly helped me. They filed a
case in court to waive the ban on my novel. The fact that
we printed content advisory and warning on the front side
of the cover page, helped the republishing of my novel.
My  novel  was  republished  on  a  large  scale  by  the
publishers  who  rejected  it  previously.  My  novel  was
translated into other Indian languages. I wrote the English


# version of my novel from the prison. It was published in
English too. I told Hussain to collect the royalty money I
received from my novels, and give it to Bhushan’s guard.

Sharan visited me. He brought chapathi with the special
curry.

“Do you remember, Sahith?, you used to tell me that my
customers would ask me about you.”, Sharan questioned
me.

“Yes. I do remember.”

“Every customer is now asking about you, Sahith.”

I am not happy, now. What is more tragic than becoming
the  person  you  hate?  My  father’s  final  words  hit  me
harder, now.

I  wouldn’t  have  become  popular  if  I  hadn’t  killed
Bhushan. But, I would at least be free from this guilt.


# Now, you are ready to understand the different prison, I
talked about. This is going to get philosophical from here.
Philosophy is told by incompetent people like me. But it
is  still  very  essential.  The  prison  I  am  talking  about,  is
abstract. You are locked up in this prison by the following
aspects:

1)  Resentment  caused  due  to  continuous  failure.
When you work hard, and you don’t get the result,
you lose faith. You’ll grow bitter.

2)  Strong desire for vengeance, which will make you

feel powerful.

3)  Inferiority complex. This is an interesting one, and
a complex one. After my father’s arrest, I felt a lot
inferior  to  my  fellow  classmates.  A  different
treatment  made  me  feel  I  am  morally  inferior  to
others.  No  one  used  to  appreciate  me  for  the
something  I  deserve. As  a defence  mechanism,  I
started  considering  all  other  people  as  dumb
people, who do not have a capability to understand
me. So, I developed a kind of superiority complex
with respect to certain things.


# 4)  Self-pity: Excessively feeling sad about your own
bad  circumstances/  misfortunes  that  happen  to
you. This will fuel your resentment.

5)  Rage: Rage is what made me to kill Bhushan. Rage
is  what  made  my  father  to  kill  that  doctor.We
cannot  meet  all  the  righteous  people  in  our  life.
We, sometimes, meet wrong people, during wrong
time,  in  wrong  places.  Most  of  the  time,  people
who  offend  you,  are  obvious  fools.  They  are
conventional. They never update their knowledge.
They lack empathy. They try to offend you in every
possible  way.  But,  if  you  are  easily  angered  by
them, loss is yours.

6)  Guilt: Though it is abstract, it is heavier enough to
crush you mentally. It eats  you from inside. This
has  an  exception;  psychopaths  do  not  feel  guilt.
That is why they’re called so.

It was really my pleasure, torturing Bhushan to death. I
became  a  ‘Sadist’.  Whatever  Bhushan  told  media  and
masses about me, that day, it eventually became true. I am


# in prison now. Sorry for the mistake, I was already locked
up  in  the  abstract  prison  created  by  my  mind,  which
created an illusion that I am free to do anything, because
I lost everything. That led to my actual imprisonment.

In  the  end,  I  did  just  what  my  father  had  done,  even
though  he  warned  me.  Even  though  he  urged  me  not
become enraged, no matter how much I was offended.

Why  am  I  repetitively  saying  the  same  thing.  Probably,
due to aging. It certainly is boring to you, isn’t it? Let me
end this here. I don’t have anyone to listen to all this, at
the  prison.  Thank  you  so  much,  my  dear  imaginary
audience.

Chapparapu and Venkat Sai for their support.

The following notes are presented in a q&a format.
This will explain why I wrote what I wrote.

Inception of prison

Actually,  I  did  not  write  the  first  draft  of  ‘Prison’  in
English  language.  I  wrote  it  as  a  very  short  story  that
occupies two sides of an A4 sheet if written in an average
font  size,  in  the  month  of  August,  2021.  I  wrote  it  in
Telugu, within a duration of 2 hours, for a competition
conducted  by  Ramoji  Rao’s  ETV,  to  select  writers  to
create  content  for  an  OTT  app  they  wanted  to  launch.
But, there is no update regarding that. Originally, it was
way less brutal, way less ambiguous, trying to justify the
protagonist, just because of the fact that it was the least
brutal of all the drafts of ‘Prison’. There was no mention
of Marquis de Sade, Acromegaly, Yanam, Sahith’s mother
character,  Thrigun’s  character,  his  father’s  crime,  the
entire over the top violent episode of Bhushan’s murder,
Sharan and Hussain in the first draft. None of these were
present  in  the  first  draft.  The  reason  was  simple,
according to the rules of the competition, the story should
not exceed 2 pages. I couldn’t deliver a vivid detail and
logic in that version, due to page limit. I don’t even know
whether they had read the draft I mailed them. I had left
that  work,  and  was  busy  with  academics.  But,  I  never


# thought that, those 2 pages would form the theme for my
debut. After the final exams, I felt like I had some free
time.  So,  I  thought  of  self  -publishing  a  story.  I  had  a
variety of ideas, by the time I decided to publish a story.
Some  of  them  are  comedy,  slice  of  life,  thrillers,  and
psychological  horrors.  But,  I  chose  to  write  literary
fiction, instead of genre fiction. I am not against writing
genre fiction, which is very popular form of fiction. While
I was still in confusion regarding what to choose for my
debut, I remembered a few reviews about ‘Berserk’ manga
on Amazon shopping. People who don’t how to read a
manga ( manga needs to be read from right to left, and
hardcopy of manga has to be read from backside of the
book to front side) , posted reviews that there is a mistake
in printing the book. They read hardcopy of manga from
front  side  of  the  book.  Such  people  rant  about  a
masterpiece  manga  like  Berserk.  I  have  seen  so  many
toxic fans of other anime series, spread negativity about
One Piece and Naruto, without even actually watching it.
It is the level of toxicity some people spread, using social
media. There fan wars on twitter about movie stars, where
fans of two different groups offend each other in a highly
toxic  manner.  I  knew  this  became  very  common.  This
cemented  the  theme  of  ‘Prison’,  further.  I  started
developing the first draft, adding the details, layer by layer.
I  went  on  adding  details  about  acromegaly,  Marquis  de
Sade and Yanam.


# I did know the etymology of word, ‘Sadism’. That made
me study almost all  the available information about the
life  of  Marquis  de  Sade.  I  haven’t  read  any  of  Sade’s
novels,  because  they  were  written  in  older  English.  I,
personally, do not want to tire myself by reading novels
written in older English. This is just my opinion. It is not
a desecration to older English. So, I read the synopsis of
two of his novels, ‘Justine’, and ‘The school of libertinage’
( 120 days of Sodom). The latter is regarded as the most
brutal piece of fiction ever written in history of literature.
Synopsis  is  enough  to  cement  that  statement.  I  read
articles about Sade, wrote some essential points.

Why is the story set in Andhra Pradesh, India?

If  the story  is  set in  foreign country, it would not have
created  enough  conflict  from
the  society.  You’ll
understand this, if you have read the story.

Why Yanam?

The name of Marquis de Sade, and the term sadism were
not popular in India at the time in which this story was
set. Everything about Sade was kept as a secret, due to his
notorious life. By the timeline in which my story was set,
if you think rationally, it would not be possible for Indians
to know about Sade, and sadism.I needed a connection
between France and India. It was then, Yanam came to
rescue. During French rule in India, Yanam was a French


# colony. It was under French rule, upto 1954. Now, it is
under the governance of Union territory of Pondicherry.
I haven’t been to Yanam. I took the help of tourist vlogs
and  wikipedia  and  Google  images  to  know  how  the
Yanam looks like, and what are the prominent places in
Yanam.  Using  that,  I  described  Yanam.  If  any  of  the
readers,  has  been  to  Yanam  or,  is  a  native  of  Yanam,
please forgive me if I made any inaccurate description of
Yanam.

What was my worry while writing the 1st 4 chapters?

In the first 4 chapters, I was setting up the story in a subtle
and  slow  manner.  I  was  giving  more  information.  I
worried  it  would  face  a  problem  due  to  information
dumping. I thought reader may not be engaged, because
the inciting incident never showed up in those chapters.
Moreover,  the  language  I  used,  more  references  to  our
state culture, like chapathi and Yanam. These made my
story more localised. If someone from the state read this,
by  chance,  or  even  our  state  readers  who  read  foreign
novels,  may  not  feel  the  connect,  if  they  couldn’t
understand the reference. I felt it may put off the reader’s
interest, because I felt it sounded different while I read it
myself.  Thankfully,  a  reader  liked  it.  Some  readers
resonated with my opinion on this. I respect everyone’s
opinion.


# Why was medical terminology used?

It  was  definitely,  not  used  to  show  off  that  I  know
something. It was used to convince the intelligent readers,
that I did my part of research before writing the work. I
don’t  want  to  insult  the  intelligence  of  my  readers.  (  A

What made me finally decide, that this has to be my
debut…

Within  a  week  ago,  or  so,  ‘Berserk’  manga  admirer,
RealLifeRyan  posted  on  his  YouTube  channel  of  same
name, a video which roasted the worst Twitter reviews on
Berserk manga. I watched the video. Some of the reviews,
really tried hard to damage Kentaro  Miura’s  reputation.
He  was  one  of  the  greatest  mangaka  of  all  time,  in  my
honest opinion, he gave a story that would be evergreen
and  cherished  forever.  It  is  the  most  intriguing  and
impactful manga. The art of the manga was  top tier. A
reviewer wished death upon Miura, for writing Berserk.
Miura is not here ( he died of acute aortic dissection, in
May, 2021), to come across this shitty, stupid, irrational
and useless rant about him. This kind of toxic criticism
resonated  with  the  theme  of  my  story.  It  is  one  of  the


# themes  I  wanted  to  convey  to  my  readers,  through
‘Prison’.

Why is the over-the-top violence?

I know that this is a wrong choice to write ‘Prison’ as my
debut. But, I know that it should be published at some
point, if I start publishing what I write. I wanted to show
the  extent  to  which  a  human  can  go.  How  brutal  his
actions may become, when he reaches his breaking point.
I want to show the darkness of human psyche. If I tell
you that people are ‘evil’, it won’t be that impactful. I have
to show you how evil they are.

Why are the adult themes?

It was used to show the contrast between Bhushan and
Sahith.  Bhushan  commented  on  representation  of
infidelity  in  Sahith’s  novel.  But,  Bhushan,  himself,  is
involved in infidelity, in his private space. When a person
is completely aloof or far way  from society, in a closed
space, his/her repressed parts are expressed completely.
That  is  one  of  the  themes  of  ‘School  of  libertinage’.  I
don’t want to shy away from speaking about the themes
people feel uncomfortable about. I don’t want to pretend
I am good, to impress people. I wanted to be shameless


# and honest with my readers, exposing my true self. In that
process,  I  apologise  for  making  your  Google  search
history impure. I am sorry if you are made uncomfortable
by any of the themes.

The power of fiction (this Is just my opinion, which
I  developed  through  experience.  I  don’t  know
whether this theory is certified by any psychological
studies or not.)

Fiction ignites your imagination, and increases your ability
to empathize. Fiction may help you know about yourself.
I shall give you three scenarios,

1)  If  you  hated  something  shown  in  fiction,  to  a  high
extent, it may tell you two things about you:

a)  You  either  unconsciously  hate  that  part/quality  of
yourself,  which  is  being  projected  through  some  other
character, or b) you are really a very empathetic person
who cannot tolerate that something horrible is done by a
character to another character.

2) If you love some character shown in fiction, to a high
extent, you unconsciously, want to become that person,
and originally, you are not that kind of person.

3) If a piece of fiction depicts a gruesome act, and if you
are  happy  to  see  that  happen,  it  tells  you  more  about


# yourself, and your state of mind, than that of the person
who wrote it.

Why didn’t Sahith attack Thrigun?

Thrigun lives in some other place now, far from Sahith’s
and Bhushan’s town. When Sahith was a child, Thrigun
sent his men to reveal Sahith’s family background to his
neighbourhood, and his school. This means that there are
people  who  work  under  Thrigun.  Probably,  they  may
even  be  his  guards.  Sahith  cannot  face  and  fight  those
many people guarding Thrigun’s home, because Sahith is
not a martial artist or a karate kid or Kung fu panda, he is
an author.

A  reader  asked  me  to  elaborate  on  the  crime
committed by Sahith’s father…

Sahith’s  father  was  a  blacksmith,  he  was  angered  by  a
doctor, who  is his customer. There  was a knife  nearby,
Sahith’s father killed the doctor in rage. Since, it is a short
story, I didn’t want to elaborate on this sub-plot. Sahith’s
father did not kill him by an accident, it was due to instant
rage. The act was definitely evil.

About the pacing

I deliberately wanted it to be slow pace. There is a reason
for sudden change of pace. I wanted to create an opinion


# in reader’s mind about being quick in judging, if the reader
thought  why  on  earth  is  the  author  writing  about
chapathi, Yanam, etc., in a slow pace, I wanted them to
be shocked by sudden change of pace from slow to fast,
and tone of the story from subtle to brutal, so that I can
create  a  feeling  that  they  shouldn’t  judge  anything  too
quick,i.e., one of the themes of my story.

About the cover page

My classmate Yatish Sriram designed the cover page for
the book version of ‘Prison’. Actually, there’s a previous
version  of  ‘Prison’  on  Wattpad.  It’ll  continue  to  be
available on Wattpad. This newer version is more refined
than the Wattpad version of Prison.

How long did I take to write the English version and
publish it on Wattpad?

I took 10 days, 3 days to finish pre-writing works, outline
and  cover  page,  and  a  week  to  write  the  story,  edit  it
multiple  times,  and  finally  hit  the  publish  button.  I
worked on it for 4 or 5 hours a day.


# Why do I even write?

Because, I find solace in writing. I am not obsessed with
the number of reads this story gets. I just wanted to give
my readers an experience that I get while I consume any
form of quality fiction.

Are you’re theme anything new?

If it is about son of a criminal being treated differently, it
is not a new thing. You can see it in Vijay Thalapathy’s
Bigil movie or even in a manga called ‘My dearest self with
malice  aforethought’.  But  linking  it  to  the  life  of  an
author, and criticism surrounding it, is a different take on
that trope/theme.

How writing became my hobby….

When I was in 3rd std., I had a friend called Mani Praneeth.
He used to write a fantasy story, called ‘Crystal light’, for
that story, I used to draw pictures of the characters. I was
not a writer, first. I was an artist, who drew whatever he
felt like drawing with an Apsara pencil. (Not pencil brand
advertisement. They did not sponsor me anything. That
YouTube  channel  mentioned  previously,  that  also,  did
not sponsor me anything. I just mentioned it). It was fun,
drawing. I am not a pro artist. But, simply enjoyed that.


# Later, in 5th std., we parted ways as I went to a different
school. In 6th std., our maths teacher, Murali sir, narrated
a horror story in remedial period. I was fascinated by the
way he narrated it. From then on, I orally narrated stories
to my classmate, Tej Pavan. He used to patiently listen to
my naïve and foolish stories. Later, he  went to  another
school.  I  hope  it  was  not  because  of  my  stories.  I  lost
touch  with  both  Mani  Praneeth,  after  5th  std.,  and  Tej
Pavan from 7th standard. 7th standard was zero year with
respect  to  my  storytelling.  From  8th  std.,  I  got  another
listener,  my  friend,  G.Siddhartha.  He  is  a  very  rational
guy.  He  used  to  constructively  criticize  my  stories,  and
find  loopholes  in  them.  I  gradually,  corrected  myself.  I

threw  away  all

They  felt  like  they  are  subconsciously  contrived,  and
unoriginal. The best phase of my writing began from the
2nd  year  of  intermediate.  Regarding  fiction,  I  consume

I  confess  that  I’m  not  an  avid  reader.  Among  novels,
Chuck  Palahniuk’s Fight  club is of a great influence on
me.  It  was  the  first  transgressive  work  I  consumed.  I
watched the movie first, during my intermediate, and then
read the book. Works of Fyodor Dostoevsky are also a
influence  on  me.  I  started  reading  western

# philosophers like Nietzsche and Schopenhauer during my
+2.

When  it  comes  to  movies,  I  watch  movies  from  all
languages (only if subtitles are available). There are many
movies  which
impacted  my  writing.  My  favourite
directors are David Fincher, Coen brothers, Christopher
Nolan,  Park  Chan  Wook,  Bong  Joon  Ho,  Andrei
Tarkovsky,  Martin  Scorsese,  Quentin  Tarantino,  Paul
Thomas  Anderson,  Alejandro  Inarittu,  Sachy,  Upendra,

their own authentic style).
